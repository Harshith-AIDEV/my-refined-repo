Step 1

Install Git from the official website:
ðŸ”— https://gitforwindows.org


---

Step 2

Install the latest version of Python (e.g., Python 3.13.5) from:
ðŸ”— https://www.python.org


---

Step 3

While installing Git, accept all default settings shown during setup.


---

Step 4

While installing Python, also accept all default settings.


---

Step 5

Open Git Bash (search for it in the Windows Start Menu).


---

Step 6

Configure your Git name and email (required only once per device):

git config --global user.name "Harshith Kottugumada"
git config --global user.email "harshithkottugumada1977@gmail.com"


---

Step 7

Create your first repository:

mkdir my-first-repo
cd my-first-repo
git init


---

Step 8

Make your first commit:

git commit -m "My first commit"

(You need to add files before this, but it's okay to initialize first.)


---

Step 9

Check if the commit was saved:

cd my-first-repo
git log


---

Step 10

Now create your second repository:

mkdir my-second-repo
cd my-second-repo
git init


---

Step 11

Confirm Git is using your name and email:

git config user.name
git config user.email

You should see your name and email â€” this confirms itâ€™s correctly linked.


---

Step 12

Check if Python is working inside Git Bash:

python --version

You should see something like Python 3.13.5.


---

Step 13

Enter the Python interactive mode by typing:

python

You should see the prompt:

> > >

---

Step 14 (Optional)

Type a simple line to test it:

print("Hello, world!")

Then type exit() to leave Python.
(if you are confident about saving your project file directly skip to step17)

---

Step 15 (optional)

Write your first Python file directly in Git Bash using nano:

nano hello_world.py

Inside nano, type:

print("Hello, world!")

Then save using:

Ctrl + O â†’ Press Enter

Ctrl + X to exit

Run the file using:

python hello_world.py


---

Step 16

Add and commit the file to Git:

git add hello_world.py
git commit -m "Added hello world Python script"


---

Step 17

What if your Python file is written somewhere else (like in the Python shell)?

Copy the code, and paste it into a new file using nano:

cd ~/my-second-repo
nano beginner_calculator.py

Paste the code, then save and exit using Ctrl + O, Enter, and Ctrl + X.


---

Step 18

Run your file to make sure it works:

python beginner_calculator.py


---

Step 19

Add and commit your project:

git add beginner_calculator.py
git commit -m "Add beginner calculator project"


---

Step 20

Repeat this process for your other beginner Python projects.
For example:

mad_libs_game.py

temp_converter.py

simple_mood_check.py

Each file:

1. nano filename.py


2. Paste code


3. Save â†’ Ctrl + O, Enter


4. Exit â†’ Ctrl + X


5. git add filename.py


6. git commit -m "Add description"




---

Step 21

To confirm all files are saved:

git log

This will show the commit history.


---

Step 22

ðŸ’¡ For GUI-based modules like turtle:
Yes, they work with Python â€” just make sure to run from a Python environment that supports GUI (not Git Bash directly).

You can still store the file using:

nano turtle_hello_gui.py

Then add and commit it like before.


---
Step 23

ðŸš€ Bonus Tip:
You can transfer .py files using a USB cable if needed, and move them into your Git repo folder. But nano is perfect when you're writing from scratch or copying manually.
