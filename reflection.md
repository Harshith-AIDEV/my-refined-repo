# - Reflection

All the projects in this repository were originally created and tested in my experimental workspace: **my-second-repo**. That was my first real hands-on trial-and-error journey with Git, file organization, and Python basics.

It took me around **6 hours** in that repo — dealing with:
- File loss and recovery
- Git commit issues
- Confusing logs
- Command line mistakes

But that messy phase was a **great practice ground**.

After learning from those mistakes, I set up this `my-refined-repo` in just **30 minutes**, smoothly and error-free. This clean repo now holds all the polished versions of my beginner Python projects.

> **This repo is a symbol of my learning curve — from confusion to clarity.**
